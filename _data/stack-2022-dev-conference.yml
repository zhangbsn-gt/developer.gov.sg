  title: Extending the AWS Cloud Outside of Public Regions
  desc: The AWS Nitro System is the underlying platform for our next generation of EC2 instances that enables AWS to innovate faster, further reduce cost for our customers, and deliver added benefits like increased security and new instance types. AWS has completely re-imagined our virtualisation infrastructure. Traditionally, hypervisors protect the physical hardware and bios, virtualise the CPU, storage, networking, and provide a rich set of management capabilities. With the Nitro System, we are able to break apart those functions, offload them to dedicated hardware and software, and reduce costs by delivering practically all of the resources of a server to your instances. In this talk, we will explore the improved hardware-based security in the Nitro System, including how we can leverage this technology outside of traditional public cloud regions using AWS Outposts and Local Zones.

  title: Simplifying Data and AI with Lakehouse Platforms
  desc: "Traditionally, building data and AI applications in most enterprises has been complex because data is stored and processed across many disparate systems: data lakes such as Amazon S3, SQL data warehouses, message bus systems, and others. Enterprises have to staff large data engineering projects to move data across these systems, and end-users experience long delays and reliability problems. In the past few years, the cloud and open source have enabled a new class of data platform that unifies data lakes and warehouses, the lakehouse, and makes it significantly easier to share data across an organisation for all use cases. Because these platforms use open source formats, they are also directly usable in AI and streaming applications. I will describe how lakehouse systems such as the open source Delta Lake project, and how Databricks customers are using the lakehouse to achieve unprecedented scale and operational simplicity across analytics and AI use cases."
