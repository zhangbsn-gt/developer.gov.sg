<p>
  Here's how you can help the Singapore Government in its digital efforts to
  combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p>

<h3>Be a volunteer</h3>

<p>
  The Government has progressively built up the digital infrastructure and
  engineering capabilities as the foundation of our Smart Nation. This has
  enabled us to respond decisively and swiftly to the COVID-19 outbreak with a
  suite of digital tools to help disseminate timely and accurate information to
  Singaporeans and to enable our public agencies to better manage the crisis.
</p>
<p>
  Refer below for more details about some products we’ve developed thus far, and
  the volunteering opportunities in which you can lend a helping hand.
