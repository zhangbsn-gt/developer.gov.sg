### Overview

The 2022 Working Groups (WGs) saw representatives share experiences and opportunities on topics covering Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Identity and Cybersecurity.

- **The AI WG** developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of good practices to guide teams that are building or procuring AI projects. The areas covered are based on common thematic areas derived from the co-designed survey as well as secondary research on good practices from international GovTech and AI communities.
- **The Digital Identity WG** looked at how Verifiable Credentials (VCs) were being utilised by member countries and explored current and future digital identity related challenges. The areas covered by this WG also included the architectural and policy requirements of member countries' Digital Identity systems needed to facilitate VCs, as well as how international interoperability can be achieved. 
- **The Cybersecurity WG** summarised insights from several months of discussions on governments’ and the industry’s roles in Zero Trust, approaches that governments adopt to incorporate Zero Trust practices to their respective environments, and additional cybersecurity techniques to complement a Zero Trust architecture.
