### Overview

Government Agencies would be including technical assessments in quality evaluations increasingly. This aims to uplift the digital capabilities of Singapore’s ICT industry, which supports Government projects, and to provide a more objective validation of the competency of teams bidding for Government projects. The technical assessments would be an added criterion for quality evaluation, in addition to relevant certifications and track record, which Agencies may include in their quality evaluation.

As a start, the two roles which would have to undergo technical assessments would be Solution Architects and Software Developers working on application projects.

**A phased approach is taken to introduce the assessments in tenders progressively. New developments will be updated on this page by early FY22.**

### Implementation of Technical Assessments

Tenderers will be required to send a few personnel who will be a part of the project when awarded to undertake the technical assessment during the evaluation phase. Results will contribute to the quality score of the Tenderer. Upon awarding the project, the successful Tenderer would need to send their remaining team members under the specific roles for the assessment. These may vary according to project requirements. Tenderers should refer to the tender specififications and attend tender briefings (if any) to understand the specific requirements and details of the technical assessment.
