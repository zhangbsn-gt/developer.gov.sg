<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Modern web applications commonly use
  <a href="https://gds-apex.gitbook.io/api/summary/use-restful" target="_blank"
    >REST APIs</a
  >
  to faciliate communications between programs. The following API playbook aims
  to encourage consistency, maintainability and good API practices within the
  Singapore Government so that development teams can easily leverage on
  conventions and standards to build digital services more quickly and
  intuitively. The API playbook has so far been maintained by the <a href="/technologies/apex">Apex</a>
  team.
</p>
<p>
  These guidelines represent one suggested way of designing REST web-based APIs
  for most scenarios in the Government. Depending on your use case, there could
  be other principles more suited for you that might not be covered in this
  guide.
