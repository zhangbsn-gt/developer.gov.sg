<h4>Development</h4>
<p>The development environment (dev) is the environment in which changes to software are developed, most simply an individual developer's workstation. This differs from the ultimate target environment in various ways - the target may not be a desktop computer, and even if otherwise similar, the developer's environment will include development tools like a compiler, integrated development environment, different or additional versions of libraries and support software,, which are not present in a user's environment.</p>
