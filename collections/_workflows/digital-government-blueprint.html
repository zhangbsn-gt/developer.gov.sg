<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Digitalisation is a key pillar of the Government’s public service transformation efforts. The Digital Government
    Blueprint (DGB) is a statement of the Government’s ambition to better leverage data and harness new technologies,
    and to drive broader efforts to build a digital economy and digital society, in support of Smart Nation.</p>
<p>Our vision is to create a Government that is “Digital to the Core, and Serves with Heart”. A Digital Government will
    be able to build stakeholder-centric services that cater to citizens’ and businesses’ needs. Transacting with a
    Digital Government will be easy, seamless and secure. Our public officers will be able to continually upskill
    themselves, adapt to new challenges and work more effectively across agencies as well as with our citizens and
    businesses.</p>
<p>Here is how the DGB will benefit you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Electronic payment and digital signature options for 100% of Government services</li>
    <li>Intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use digital services</li>
    <li>Greater confidence in your data as digital services infrastructure continues to be fortified</li>
    <li>More digital services like Moments of Life and Business Grants Portal built around your needs.</li>
</ul>
