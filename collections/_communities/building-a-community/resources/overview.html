<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Here are some resources to help you along your community engagement journey. We have developed these in response to our own experiences as well as many community leaders who have helped us set STACK-X up.

  We will continue to share more resources in time so bookmark this page! In the meantime, we look forward to having you join our community on <a href="https://go.gov.sg/stackxmeetup">STACK-X Meetup</a> and the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/stackxtelegram">STACK-X Telegram group</a>.
