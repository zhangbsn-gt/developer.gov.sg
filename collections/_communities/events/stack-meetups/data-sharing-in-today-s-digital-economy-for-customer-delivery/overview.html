<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    As the API Economy leads the way for how Digital Economy activities impact public agencies and local businesses,
    creating digital solutions to be more responsive to customer delivery processes is a priority. Data-sharing
    technology is also growing at an accelerated pace as it plays a crucial role in distributing and receiving data to
    harness numerous and disparate data sources, resulting in robust, cost-effective practices.
</p>
<p>
    Government organisations recognise that responsive, personalised, and efficient government services are not only
    increasingly expected by citizens, they also result in better mission success, improved cost-effectiveness, and
    increased citizen trust.
</p>
<p>
    In response to these developments, GovTech has built the Asynchronous Data Exchange (ADEX). ADEX is hosted on the
Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC) and serves as a centralised, self-service data exchange and event streaming
platform for public agencies and local businesses to share and receive lightweight, real-time data securely.
</p>
<p>
    In this Meetup with GovTech’s ADEX team and Confluent, our speakers will be discussing the various data-sharing
    solutions used by the public sector and industry to overcome challenges in sharing data efficiently and securely,
    leading to robust, cost-effective practices.
