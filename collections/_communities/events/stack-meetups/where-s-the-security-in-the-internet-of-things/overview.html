<!-- Event details -->
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Who should attend: If you are a software engineer, IoT engineer, device manufacturer or security manager, this talk is
  for you!
</p>
<p>
  The Internet of Things (IoT) technologies offer many potential benefits to consumers and organisations. Some uses of
  IoT include the monitoring of sensor data, system automation, and the remote control of smart devices.
</p>
<p>
  With the advancements in low-powered computing and lower costs of implementation, we are witnessing an acceleration of
  the transformation of traditional analog systems into smart systems. However, more often than not, the security aspect
  of IoT systems tend to lag behind the technological advancements.
</p>
<p>As such, hackers are turning to IoT smart systems as a prime target to pounce on.</p>
<p>In the first session, Keith and Jing Loon will be sharing insights on exploiting vulnerabilities in an IoT ecosystem
  from a hacker’s perspective. The sharing will include the thought process for identifying vulnerabilities, common ways
  of exploitation, and key security issues which IoT implementers should be mindful of.
</p>
<p>
  In the second session, Kelvin will be discussing about possible security measures that device manufacturers can adopt
  to improve the security posture of their products. He will highlight the risks that may arise from a smart device
  concept, the importance of getting the requirements right at the start of a product development lifecycle, and the
  security considerations around the hardware and software of device development.
