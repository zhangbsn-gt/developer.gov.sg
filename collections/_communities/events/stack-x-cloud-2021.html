          Hsiao Ming leads Engineering Productivity at Government Digital

          accelerate the development of digital services for the Government.
          This includes the Application Programming Interface Exchange (APEX) -
          a centralised government-wide API library and the Next-Generation
          Container Architecture (NECTAR) a cloud-based platform-as-a-service
          which streamlines and accelerates the process of application
          development. As part of the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS),
          APEX and NECTAR allow the public and private sectors to collaborate
          effectively and efficiently on digital projects that create value for
          citizens. A software engineer by trade, Hsiao Ming likes to explore
          new developments related to cloud, containers and programming. In his
          spare time, he dabbles with IoT devices and runs a small hydroponics
          setup on his balcony.
