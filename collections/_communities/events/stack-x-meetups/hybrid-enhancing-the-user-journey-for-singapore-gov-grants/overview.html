<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    With the sheer number of grants offered by various government agencies across different platforms, it may be
    challenging for applicants to discover and apply for suitable grants. Additionally, grant processes are often
    largely manual for both grant applicants and administrators, leading to longer lead times in approving much-needed
    grants.
</p>
<p>
    In this Tech for Public Good-themed Meetup, our speakers will share about designing the Singapore Government’s grant
    administration ecosystem, which consists of <b>OurSG Grants (OSG) Portal</b>, the <b>Business Grants Portal
        (BGP)</b> , and the
    <b>Fraud Detection Platform (FDP)</b>. The tripartite approach of OSG, BGP, and FDP facilitates a greatly improved
    application and administration process for Government assistance to harmonise and streamline the grant journey as
    well as provide enhanced grant governance.
</p>

<p>
    The session will discuss and demo a backend module which was built to ensure that agencies can set up grants on the
    portals with minimal development effort to scale the onboarding process. The team will also talk about continually
    enhancing support for businesses and citizens, including the unexpected operation challenges during COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
    In line with Singapore’s Smart Nation initiatives, GovTech partnered the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth
    and its agencies to develop the OSG Portal, and the Ministry of Trade & Industry’s (MTI) Grant Management Office for
    BGP. For additional security, FDP, which was developed by GovTech in collaboration with MTI, was also integrated
    into the portals.
