<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  In this Tech for Public Good-themed STACK-X Meetup, the team behind <b>GovWallet</b>, GovTech’s latest digital tool,
  will share the technicalities of this improved way of distributing government payouts.
</p>
<p>
  GovWallet removes the need for public agencies to develop multiple, similar disbursement systems and streamlines
  organisational processes for faster payouts. More importantly, it reduces the number of steps for users to receive
  government-issued monies and credits. GovWallet also enables users without a bank account to withdraw cash at ATMs,
  and allows them to spend their credits on selected merchants via the LifeSG app.
</p>
<p>
  The GovTech team will be taking you through the GovWallet development journey of improving the user experience for
  citizens, and lowering the barrier of entry for more merchants to participate in this scheme. Hear behind-the-scenes
  stories on the challenges faced by the team in developing key features of GovWallet too!
