  - title: '9:00 - 9:20PM: Sharing by Dr. Tan Min Han, Lucence'
    desc: 'Lucence has very recently developed SAFER-Sample™ kit - a saliva sample collection kit intended for non-invasive collection and transport of saliva samples for PCR-based testing of viral RNA, such as SARS-CoV-2. This approach promises to improve safety and reduce hazards for healthcare personnel by avoiding swab aerosols. Further, precious personal protective equipment (PPE) in short supply can be reserved for use in hospitals. With increased accessibility, self-collection is easier to achieve on a broader scale.'
