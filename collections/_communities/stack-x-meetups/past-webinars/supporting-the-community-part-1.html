    SupplyAlly.</em>
</p>
<h3>How SupplyAlly was born</h3>
<p>
  SupplyAlly, or Sally for short, is a mobile app that facilitates the process
  of logistics distribution, especially in times of need during COVID-19 and the
  post-COVID era. While STACK-X Meetup participants might know of it, and even
  make use of Sally in their own distribution campaigns, not many know of the
  circumstances behind Sally’s development.
</p>
<p>It started with a phone call on April 1st.</p>
<p>
  Steven Koh, Director of Government Digital Services at GovTech, received a
  call from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the People’s
  Association (PA). They wanted to know if GovTech could develop an app that
  would digitalise the nationwide reusable mask distribution exercise.
</p>
<p>
  When was the distribution exercise going to start? <em>April 5th, </em>came
  the reply.
</p>
<p>
  In the span of four days, our engineers repurposed and refined an existing
  application into SupplyAlly, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for mask
  distribution. When we were notified of this request, we only knew that
  SupplyAlly was meant for a nationwide distribution campaign, and that masks
  were to be issued. With just this information, we had to develop an app that
  was designed with a low barrier to entry for users without much tech knowledge
  and training. As we did not know how many people were involved in distributing
  masks, we had to develop a form of authorisation and authentication that was
  scalable with the size of the volunteer efforts. A core feature of Sally was
  to allow campaign operators to learn how to use the app with basic guidance;
  for collection, Sally had to recognise identifiers such as the barcodes on
  individuals’ physical NRIC in case they lacked digital forms of
  identities.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Given the time constraints, speed was a major consideration – what are the
  essential steps for using this app, and what is the most basic way of
  verifying identities? These were key concerns for the team as we worked round
  the clock to meet the deadline.
</p>
<h3>A helping hand for the community</h3>
<p>
  Once we set Sally up, it helped MTI and the PA to distribute reusable masks
  across Singapore through the various Community Centres. To date, 4.2 million
  masks have been issued through this campaign.
</p>

<p>
  Moving ahead, we also saw great potential for Sally to support charitable
  efforts in Singapore. During the Circuit Breaker period, home-based learning
  was implemented but some children could not participate as they lacked access
  to internet laptops. That’s why we decided to partner Engineering Good to
  distribute refurbished laptops to underprivileged students for home-based
  learning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  From June onwards, we worked with the Community Development Council (CDC) and
  PA to distribute voucher booklets to families in need. Currently, our partners
  have used Sally to distribute vouchers to more than 250,000 households out of
  400,000 eligible households. Sally also directly contributes to the national
  contact tracing effort against COVID-19. In partnership with our parent
  organisation, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) and the
  Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC)’s Silver Generation Office, more than
  10,000 TraceTogether Tokens were issued to the elderly who do not own
  smartphones and other digitally-excluded members of the population. Most
  recently, we engaged Food from the Heart, a charitable organisation, to give
  out hot meals to the elderly and other service users around the Mountbatten
  area. Sally vastly simplified the process of tracking and recording items
  distributed, ensuring equitable distribution of essentials for individuals and
  households.

<h3>SupplyAlly and Cloud</h3>
<p>
  The campaigns that we’ve supported since May are actively running and
  supporting the community. Yet, when you visit Google Play or the iOS App
  Store, you don’t see multiple versions of Sally for each individual campaign.
  How do we support multiple distribution campaigns within a single app?
</p>
<p>
  The answer lies with the use of Cloud technologies that allow Sally to run
  multiple development campaigns concurrently. Individuals can then access their
  specific campaigns by logging in with a unique QR code provided for them.
</p>
<p>
  The cost of using public Cloud services was a consideration from the start of
  Sally’s development. Since campaigns run for an extended period of time, we
  needed to calculate and determine how much memory was used against the costs
  charged by the provider. Using serverless solutions (where one only pays for
  the computing power they use) also helped us scale rapidly when needed, since
  we saved costs by consuming less resources when certain campaigns were not
  activated.
</p>
<p>
  <em
    >Is it safe to use public cloud services, considering the government’s need
    for security?</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  On our Government Commercial Cloud (GCC), we follow leading data management
  practices and further protect data by using secure services. Sally also does
  not store any personal identifiable information such as service users’ NRIC
  information. Instead, the app merely takes a fingerprint of the information in
  accordance with data management guidelines.
</p>
<h3>Developing one app for multiple partners</h3>
<p>
  The next question that arose during Sally’s development was: can we cater for
  our partners’ varying needs and wants, even as their campaigns are running
  under one app?
</p>
<p>
  Recognising that both present and future partners are going to differ on this
  aspect, our team stayed true to our DNA and focused on establishing consistent
  fundamentals.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Three things remain the same throughout all the distribution campaigns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Our partner organisations or agencies will tell us how to identify
      legitimate beneficiaries and Sally will use the criteria accordingly. NRIC
      scanning is enabled, as is QR code scanning, which Food from the Heart
      uses.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Service users’ collections are recorded within a given time period. For
      example, if an individual is eligible for one ice cream weekly, the
      collection count for this person will be reset every week. Depending on
      the campaign’s requirements, the time period can be adjusted accordingly –
      some use cases include determining how long an individual is assigned an
      item or how many times an item can be distributed to the individual.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The operator of the app is also notified on individuals’ eligibility and
      past transactions.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>The customer journey for different stakeholders</h3>
<p>
  <em
    >As a service user, I know that the Government is giving me some resources
    that I’m entitled to. What do I do next?</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  You only need to bring your means of identification as specified by the
  distribution campaign. For some partner agencies, it could be your NRIC, or
  even a QR code (as with Food from the Heart’s campaign).
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’m a distribution agent. What is the process like when using Sally?</em>
</p>
<p>
  Firstly, you need to scan the barcode on the physical NRIC of the service
  user. If the person is eligible to collect, the next screen will display the
  assigned quota and inform you that Sally will be capturing the details of the
  item being given out. When you proceed, the item will be redeemed, recorded
  and tracked within the system.
</p>
<p>
  If the entitlement is exceeded, there will be an error notification that
  indicates when the person last collected the item.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >What’s next for Sally, and what have we learnt throughout the
    journey?</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  When we reach out to our many partners of varying digital literacy levels, we
  seek to learn about their experiences with Sally. Has it been working for
  them? How difficult is it to use?
</p>
<p>
  From our development journey and the feedback we’ve received, we’ve identified
  some new features that Sally can benefit from.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Empowering users to allow appeals when individuals’ entitlement limits
        are reached. </strong>We want to give campaign distributors the option to allow individuals to
      collect again, and have these extra collections tracked in the
      system.&nbsp; We’re also pleased to announce that this feature has been
      developed and tested – it will be ready for release in September.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Some of the error messages and feedback displayed to app users are not
        intuitive.</strong> Since the messages are more technically-driven than user-driven, they can
      be a little hard to understand sometimes. That’s why we revamped these
      messages to help users overcome simple issues while using Sally. These
      changes will also be released in September.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Improving the login process for Sally.</strong> The login code is
      key for allowing people to log into various environments so that multiple
      campaigns can be run concurrently. But the code can be lost, and the
      administrative side of the campaign has the heavy responsibility of
      managing thousands of QR login codes for the distributors. That’s why
      we’re exploring ways to improve this login process through rethinking and
      redesigning the status quo.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Displaying statistics on the app. </strong>Users from PA and other
      partner organisations have asked us about this option, and it’s something
      we’re looking into implementing down the road.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Including non-English users of Sally. </strong>Another
      consideration that the team is working toward is the inclusion of Chinese
      translations to Sally, for a start. We believe that this would aid users
      even more, increasing Sally’s user-friendliness.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Developing Sally feels like rock climbing. There’s always one more step to
  take, and sometimes it gets really difficult depending on the terrain you’re
  on. While passion has led us here, there’s still much more work ahead. But
  more work also means more opportunities, and it’s a sign that the team needs
  to work harder to take advantage of them.
