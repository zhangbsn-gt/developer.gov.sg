  <h2>GovTech’s Community Development Efforts</h2>
  <p>
      We are excited to engage with the wider developer ecosystem as we continue to build and refine digital
      products. We believe that our goal – to build better products for the public good – can be achieved only
      through meaningful collaboration with the developer community.
