<h3>Playbooks and Additional Resources</h3>

<p>Along the way, we have also developed resources and methodologies to address some of the common challenges faced by agencies in their transformation efforts.</p>
<p>Some of these best practices have been condensed into the different playbooks to address the needs of agencies based on their individual needs relevant to the data maturity of their organisation.

<h4>Analytics by Design</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    Analytics By Design (ABD in short) is a new methodology that GovTech is piloting to improve the analytics-readiness of projects. A project that is analytics-ready will allow Data Scientists, Analysts and even business teams to quickly get down to analysis and derive insights faster. Conversely, a project that is not analytics-ready will encounter issues on data extraction, or risk having dirty and incomplete data derail the analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be applied broadly, be it building products & platforms, running programmes, or drafting policies. It helps you become more data-driven in your work, and makes the data work for you by uncovering actionable insights to improve your project’s prospects for success from the start.

<h4>Data Transformation Playbook</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    The data transformation journey of an organisation can be challenging. It goes beyond having a few successful data projects; a whole suite of enablers must be put in place, ranging from organisation structure, training, infrastructure to building up a strong data culture. Our playbook shares tactics on how you can embark on your data transformation journey in 2 parts - the first part begins with a short story to illustrate the concepts in a fun and engaging manner before the second part where we dive into details supporting the various data transformation tactics.
  </p>

<h4>Public Sector AI Playbook</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    While many agencies in the Government have started to scope AI projects, significant value has yet to be delivered from the use of AI. Two key gaps identified in the strategy were (i) the lack of awareness of major AI use cases and (ii) the lack of ops-tech capabilities to initiate AI projects by public officers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The National Artificial Intelligence Office (NAIO) and Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) have developed a Playbook on AI. This playbook provides public officers, especially non-technical officers, a guide on how AI can be adopted in their area of work and shares a range of AI projects implemented throughout the public service. This playbook will enable you to:
  </p>
  <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Understand the basic concepts of AI.</li>
	  <li>Learn how to start an AI project</li>
	  <li>Identify opportunities to adopt AI in your agency</li>
	  <li>Leverage central support for AI adoption</li>
	</ol>

<h4>Data Literacy ePrimer</h4>
<section>
  <p>
    In this age of Data & AI, a strong data culture and a workforce literate in data and AI becomes ever more important as part of an organisation’s data strategy. To many, navigating the lingo and knowledge on all things data, Data Science, AI, Machine Learning can be daunting.
  </p>
  <p>
	The Data & AI Literacy ePrimer is an eLearning package originally designed for public officers to access and learn at their own pace and convenience via mobile or web. It imparts foundational data literacy knowledge such as importance of data quality, visual analytics, machine learning, project scoping and more. Filled with videos and real-life examples contextualised for the public service, this ePrimer is a useful reference for all public officers wanting to know more about data.
  </p>
  <p>
	In this ePrimer series, we take a step back to explore what all these really means to someone operating in this new digital era by reducing the technical jargons into layman understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
	In this series of 5 modules, you will learn about:
	<ol>
	  <li>What are some capabilities, applications strengths and weakness of Data Science and AI today?</li>
    <li>Why is good Data so critical to the whole endeavour to get Data Science and AI right?</li>
    <li>What is Visual Analytics and why doing it well will improve the quality of the data we collect, and enhance the data stories we tell through the dashboards we build?</li>
    <li>Why do the algorithms and techniques behind Data Science and AI work the way they do?</li>
    <li>How do you sharpen problem statements to be solvable through Data Science and AI techniques and applications?</li>
	</ol>
  </p>
  <p>We’re excited to share this resource to the public for learning and development purposes. Organisations are also welcome to download this ePrimer and customise or incorporate it into existing learning materials at no cost. Click <a href="/products/collections/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence/data-ai-literacy-eprimer.html" target="_blank">here</a> to find out more or download the ePrimer today!</p>
