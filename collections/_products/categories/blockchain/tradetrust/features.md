### Legal Harmonisation
As current digitalisation efforts are disjointed, TradeTrust allows for interoperability between trade partners through legal harmonization between stakeholders. This could allow the convergence of physical, financial and document chains, making automation of key processes possible. 
Standards Development 

The development of international standards allows for a transparency, visibility and maintenance of trading standards across government and business stakeholders.   

### Accreditation Structure 
TradeTrust’s accreditation structure reduces the risk of receiving fake documents/information. This in turn increases the efficiency of trade as repetitive checks can be removed. The transparency and integrity of shipment events due to TradeTrust’s accreditation structure can also lower the risks for cargo insurance. Hence, allowing for cargo insurance premiums to be revised. 

### Open-Source Software
TradeTrust’s open-source codes facilitates the easy integration of backend solutions into its network. This removes adoption barriers, promotes the digitalisation of trade, and eliminates the cost associated with printing, handling, and transportation of hardcopy documentation among stakeholders. Thus, this significantly lowers the costs of shipping and trade. 

Any party within the network can also be empowered to issue and validate trade documents, facilitating easier and smooth workflows while connecting isolated ecosystems via its interoperability. 

Through the use of DLT, verification/data will also not be centralised within a single authority, removing concerns of a single authority controlling and holding global trade data.
