### Single viewpoint across video systems

CVX links up existing video systems from multiple brands, allowing you to have a single viewpoint and single point of access across different video systems. CVX will contain pre-built adapters for many common brands of video monitoring systems (VMS).

### Common CVX API for external systems

The common API is built with pre-defined standards, providing a single point of connectivity and faster connections to external systems. For example, if your agency has a staff app, it can utilise the CVX common API to draw video feeds.

### Integration with Video Analytics System (coming soon)

Agencies can soon quickly run video analytics through CVX‘s seamless integration with the [Video Analytics System (VAS)](/products/categories/analytics/vas/){:target="_blank"} developed by GovTech, using this upcoming feature.

### Intra-agency sharing

Once your video systems are linked to CVX, you can stream live video feeds to modern web browsers, access historical videos, control cameras (pan-tilt-zoom), record videos to the CVX cloud or download snippets to laptops within your agency. A powerful permissions management system enables administrators to grant or restrict permissions by users or user groups.

### Cross-agency sharing

CVX allows administrators to grant permissions to a user from a different agency, on a time-limited basis, with just a few clicks. CVX eliminates the hassle of manually tracking access, data transfers over hard drive, or having frequent physical access to server rooms, while being compliant with Government security standards.
