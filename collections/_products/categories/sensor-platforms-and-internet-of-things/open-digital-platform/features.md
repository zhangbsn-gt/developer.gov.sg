### Communication with different smart city technologies
The ODP’s Open Standard Multiprotocol Middleware helps the platform to connect and communicate with the different district management systems that are on different communications technologies.

### Digital twin of PDD
ODP offers a digital twin, which is a virtual representation based on the real-life 3D model of PDD. The digital twin will include real-world data of the district, such as power consumption, weather forecasts and temperature readings. Developers can use the digital twin to run simulations of real-world scenarios such as flooding, or test new products and processes – such as training the software of autonomous vehicles – before actual implementation.

### Interoperability with the Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP)
The ODP will be interoperable with the SNSP developed by GovTech, to enable wider sharing of sensor data with public agencies to improve the planning and delivery of public services.

### Integration with building systems and building services
The ODP has been integrated with building systems that include elevator systems, escalator systems, building ACMV, and access control and security systems. It has also successfully been integrated with Building Services such as robotic mail delivery, electric vehicle charging stations, meeting room occupancy, and temperature monitoring and control.

### Real-time monitoring of district and facility systems and operations
The ODP integrates real-time information from a network of sensors and IoT devices.

### Data ingestion, transformation and analytics
The ODP, via its Open Standard Multiprotocol Middleware, ingests data streams from various district management systems. ODP processes and transforms these data points in real-time to sense-make for greater situation awareness. It also analyses data from these different systems and sensors. Using AI and machine learning, ODP makes predictions and send commands to actuate these systems in response to real-world happenings.
