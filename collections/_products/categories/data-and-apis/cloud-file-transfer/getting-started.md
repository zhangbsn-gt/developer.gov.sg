### How Do You Onboard CFT?

Agencies and their partners can onboard and integrate CFT as a closed beta digital service in three simple steps:

1. Qualification for Closed-Beta
	- We are no longer taking in new closed-beta users for CFT version 1.1 as we are upgrading to CFT version 2.1 from May 2022. Agencies which are keen can [register their interest](https://form.gov.sg/#!/62280856ba91100012050933){:target="_blank"} to be a closed-beta user for CFT version 2.1. 

2. Technical Assessment
	- The CFT team will review your use case and if found suitable, follow-up with you for the implementation details.
	
3. Test, Sign and Use
	- Try out the CFT APIs and if our APIs are suitable for your use, get some simple paperwork done and you are good to go!
