### Compliant with the Singapore government’s AIAS and ICT&SS Management policy

CFT automatically scans incoming files for malware and removes malicious content.

### Large file exchanges with industry partners

CFT enables public officers to exchange up to 1GB of Restricted and Sensitive-Normal files with external parties across different applications and systems securely.

### File encryption

This ensures that data from agencies are safe and tamper-proof.

### HTTPS and SFTP support

CFT uses HTTPS or SFTP protocols to establish a secure connection and to ensure that data is encrypted.


### Audit and monitor functions

Centralised controls and a simple user-interface offer end-to-end visibility on file transfers.

### Configurable security policies and workflows

Agencies can customize security policies and automated workflows according to their requirements.

### Event-driven notifications

Agencies can register their webhooks to enable real-time notifications during file transfers.

### Scheduling of file transfers

For example, uploading files to a common file repository at regular intervals.

### Time and cost savings

CFT can be set up quickly. Agencies are able to transfer files fast, without incurring the operational costs and overheads of setting up a similar service. They can scale as required based on their transfer needs.

CFT is currently in closed beta and the expected general availability (GA) date is approximately in Q1 2021. For pilot users, please note that CFT version 1.1 will be updated to CFT version 2.1 from May 2022. A comparison of the features between both versions are listed below:
