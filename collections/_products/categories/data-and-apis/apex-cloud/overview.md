APEX Cloud is a full-fledged API management solution that allows developers, product teams, agencies and, businesses to manage APIs across various stages – from registration to publication to retirement. It was born out of the need to reduce the complexity of managing multiple APIs. Compared to other API management solutions, APEX Cloud is accessible from both the intranet and the internet and is compliant with ICT&SS management guidelines (formerly known as IM8) as well as various governance standards. With more than 30 agencies onboarded, APEX Cloud has standardised government API sharing practices. 

The importance of effective API management is highlighted by the fact that APIs are critical for accessing information and functionalities across systems. Within the government, APIs are important for facilitating data exchange and enabling cross-collaboration and innovation. For businesses, they help to drive efficiency and digital services.  

Thus, through APEX Cloud, overheads for API management can be reduced, enabling users to focus on designing and developing solutions for their customers. 

Future features of APEX Cloud include API-as-Code and the API Marketplace.
