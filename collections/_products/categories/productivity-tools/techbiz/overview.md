TechBiz is a service management tool that helps government officers discover, subscribe, and manage SGTS services on a single console. It is currently in the Beta stage and is one of the three tools in the Engineering Suite of the SGTS. The other two tools are [TechPass](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/techpass/overview.html){:target="\_blank"} and TechHelp, which are in the General Availability (GA) and development stages respectively.

By integrating all SGTS services into a single console and offering a consistent and streamlined interface for users, TechBiz overcomes the complexity of reconciling subscription plans, resource usage and invoicing data across multiple services as more SGTS products are rolled out across the government.

### Key Features

The key features of TechBiz includes:

- Contract and portfolio management
- Digital billing
- Monitoring and reporting of data

### Benefits

- Reduced operational effort in managing the onboarding of new subscribers
- Provision of a common library of systems’ information

- Oversight of resource consumption for more informed planning decisions and reporting

TechBiz is now integrated with [Container Stack](https:/www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/runtime/container-stack){:target="\_blank"} and moving forward, it will be integrated with more SGTS services such as [SHIP-HATS](https:/www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/toolchain/ship-hats/){:target="\_blank"}, [StackOps](https:/www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/monitoring/stackops){:target="\_blank"} etc.
