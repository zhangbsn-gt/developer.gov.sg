enCRYPT is a one-stop, self-service web application that helps non-expert users across the Whole of Government (WOG) apply data anonymisation techniques to datasets and review re-identification risk, in compliance with the [Instruction Manual for ICT&SS Management](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/instruction-manual-for-ict-ss-management.html){:target="_blank"} (previously known as IM8) guidelines for data-sharing with non-government entities and other custom use cases.

As a central privacy toolkit for Singapore public sector users, enCRYPT makes it simple to transform and anonymise your data so you can innovate faster whilst balancing privacy and utility.

enCRYPT is developed by GovTech’s [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division](https://www.tech.gov.sg/capability-centre-dsaid){:target="_blank"} (DSAID).

### How It Works

enCRYPT is a web application that allows public service officers to upload, tag and transform data through transformation/anonymisation techniques, and address re-identification risk.

enCRYPT will soon support other privacy-preserving technologies, such as differential privacy and synthetic data generation.
