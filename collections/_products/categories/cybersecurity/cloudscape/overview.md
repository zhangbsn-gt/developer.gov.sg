The Cloud Security and Compliance Automation Platform Ecosystem (CloudSCAPE) is a GovTech-developed platform that helps agencies secure Government systems deployed on the [Government on Commercial Cloud (GCC 2.0)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud/overview.html){:target="_blank"} by providing guidance to meet compliance requirements, as well as automated scans to monitor and send alerts when systems do not meet the security baseline.

CloudSCAPE monitors deployments on GCC 2.0 in adherence to the Singapore Government's [Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems (ICT&SS) management policy](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/instruction-manual-for-ict-ss-management.html){:target="_blank"} and provides remediation guides to secure cloud resources.

CloudSCAPE is part of the monitoring component of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html){:target="_blank"}. SGTS is a set of platform tools that streamlines and simplifies the development process and enables code reuse across WOG to build secure, high-quality applications.
