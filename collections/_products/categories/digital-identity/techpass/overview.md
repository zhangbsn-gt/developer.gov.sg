### Overview

As more services go digital, the need for Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions becomes more urgent and important to enforce strict privileged access to these digital services. However, existing IAM solutions are often decentralised, making it cumbersome for users as they have to manage multiple digital identities to access different digital services, and it lowers the effectiveness of controls and governance over these identities. Furthermore, there is increasing emphasis on various security frameworks such as Zero Trust to protect end users and their organisations. In response to these problems, TechPass was developed as a federated and centralised Single Sign On (SSO) IAM for downstream developer services. With TechPass, users can reduce the number of digital identities they need to manage, and administrators can easily control access to their digital services on a single platform, while having the assurance that the management of these identity accounts complies with the relevant government policies.

TechPass is one of three tools in the Engineering Suite, which is part of the Service Management component in the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html){:target="_blank"}. Engineering Suite offers a collection of service management tools for government officers to discover, subscribe, and manage SGTS services on a single console. TechPass is currently in beta, while the other two Engineering Suite tools (TechBiz and TechHelp) are currently in development.

### What is TechPass?

TechPass is an IAM solution that is equipped with SSO. It taps on [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/){:target="_blank"}, which is an enterprise identity service from Microsoft. 

It complies with Government Instruction Manual ICT&SS Management (also known as [IM8](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8.html){:target="_blank"}). It utilises popular open standards [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/){:target="_blank"}, [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/){:target="_blank"}, and [Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html){:target="_blank"} for authentication and authorisation processes.
