### Why should Myinfo business be adopted?

To date, Myinfo business enables over 190 digital services and facilitates an average of over 500,000 monthly transactions for the public and private sectors.

By using Myinfo business’ profile, business users can enjoy less repetitive form-filling, lower incidence of mistakes resulting from human error, and a reduced need to submit physical documentation as verification to complete online transactions. For example, businesses can pre-fill digital forms for online transactions such as opening a corporate utility account or applying for SME loans by consenting to share their corporate data and applicant’s personal data from government sources via Singpass.

Since adopting Myinfo business:

- Banks were able to process account openings and loan applications faster, cutting down transaction time by 60 to 70 percent on average.
- SMEs also reported benefits of streamlined operations, shortened application times, reduced reliance on hard copy submissions, and improved access to commercial services. For example, an application that might have taken days to complete in the past now only requires a streamlined eight minutes to process.

Myinfo business API can be integrated into digital services for the public and private sector to improve customer experience and facilitate efficient online transactions. With Myinfo business, organisations can retrieve data from corporate clients and save time on B2B transactions by removing the time required for manual entry, verification and data management, resulting in higher data quality and facilitating “instant” approvals.
