Potential users can also get a quick guide about GCC 2.0 through the [GCC 2.0 Primer](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/gcc-20-primer/){:target="_blank"} which is designed to better enable government product teams to onboard GCC 2.0 and improve product teams’ understanding of GCC 2.0. 

In addition, as a follow up to the [STACK Cloud conference](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/events/stack-x-cloud-2021){:target="_blank"} on 17 November 2021, the first GCC 2.0 workshop was conducted on 26 January 2022. Additional Tech Talks were also conducted during April and July 2022 to provide more insights on onboarding GCC 2.0 for AWS and GCC 1.0 to GCC 2.0 migration for AWS.
