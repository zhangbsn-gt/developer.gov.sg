An API-based solution to manage and maintain cloud resources programmatically, through exporting existing cloud infrastructure resources into Terraform templates.

I<sub>2</sub>C is an API-based solution developed by GovTech that allows the import of existing cloud infrastructure resources for applications into Terraform files and state files organized as directories on S3 buckets.

(Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool.)

Currently, infrastructure provisioning and resource management are mostly done manually, and there are significant manual tasks involved in infrastructure resource provisioning and management.

With I<sub>2</sub>C, agencies can now simplify cloud infrastructure provisioning and resource management by using Terraform templates, thus saving time and improving efficiency.

I<sub>2</sub>C  makes cloud infrastructure provisioning and management a breeze by taking a simplistic reverse-engineering approach -- from IaC conceptualization to actual realization.

Users can subsequently use I<sub>2</sub>C-generated Terraform Templates to manage and maintain cloud resources programmatically, thus reducing human errors and increasing the speed to change.  


### Key Benefits  

- Saves time and increases efficiency for cloud infrastructure provisioning and management
- Users can manage and maintain cloud resources programmatically 
- Low-cost, serverless and cloud-native solution, with Terrafomer as a core component running inside a docker container. Other components include AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS Batch, AWS Fargate, Amazon S3, Terraform, and Checkov.
- Provides better agility, better visibility, and better portability (re-usability) over Cloud Infrastructure.

### Use Case

A development team can use the I<sub>2</sub>C tool to convert an entire AWS WorkSpaces service setup into a Terraform template, and then deployed it within one hour in another account. The same activity used to take three days by using the point-and-click interface of the AWS UI Console.

Using I<sub>2</sub>C resulted in immense time savings and a remarkable increase in efficiency, without writing code from scratch.

### Pricing

Free for government agencies to self-deploy and manage.
