1. Interested agencies will have to complete the following prerequisites before access to DIAB can be granted:
   - Own a [SHIP-HATS account](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/ship-hats-getting-started/){:target="\_blank"}
   - Read and agree to the DIAB Terms of Use
   - Submit an onboarding form with details including:
     - a write-up of use case
     - a write-up of the business value of the project
     - data classification and data sensitivity

2.  Please contact the team [here](https://form.gov.sg/62280856ba91100012050933){:target="\_blank"} to request for the DIAB Terms of Use and onboarding form.

3. An Engagement Manager will contact your agency, after the successful submission of the onboarding form.

4. After your agency has been successfully onboarded, access to DIAB’s GitLab repository will be given to the relevant parties.

5. Your agency can then make use of the reference architecture and IaC templates available in the repository, as long as the usage abides by the DIAB Terms of Use.

6. Do note that DIAB onboarding is on a project-by-project basis. For example, if there are two different project teams in your agency using DIAB, each team will have to go through the onboarding process separately.
