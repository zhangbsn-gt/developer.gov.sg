### A one-stop hub for all community and social grants
Previously, citizens had to source information across multiple resources. OSG consolidates information into a central portal, this allows the government to provide citizens with a single channel to identify and apply for relevant grants more effortlessly and efficiently.  

### End-to-end digitalisation of the grant process 
This streamlines the application and review process for government officers while allowing tracking of each step. Before the portal , grant administers also processed applications manually and in silos, which made the process unproductive and inefficient.

### Standardised grant application forms 
Standardised forms with built-in validity checks help prevent errors in form submissions by guiding citizens on what is needed. It also allows pre-filling of the form via [Myinfo.](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/myinfo/overview.html){:target="_blank"}. 

### Data aggregation and analysis tools 
Data gathered from applications, claims, and actions and be exported as an excel file for analysis by government officers and to support better grants governance.

### Inter-agency routing of applications to other relevant grants without the need for refilling of forms
Grant officers can easily route applications towards more relevant grants without requesting for applicants to re-fill forms as part of the system’s “No Wrong Door” policy.

### Data security, fraud, and grant governance 
OSG is integrated with the Fraud Detection Platform (FDP) - an internal, confidential platform that enables government agencies to conduct due diligence on grant recipients, businesses, and partners to counter fraud against Government Assistance Schemes. Approval controls, regulations, and data controls also ensure data security and grant governance. Lastly, OSG incorporates declarations such as the harmonised declaration to prevent double-dipping of grant applications.
