### What types of grants does the OSG Grants portal support? 
We currently support community grants, which are grants that support projects by individuals, organisations, and youths that promote community building and social cohesion. The types of social grants we support are grants that go to organisations that provide services to meet the social needs of individuals, families, and communities. Agencies offering such grants can use the OSG Grants portal to publish their grants and be part of a WOG platform.

### What’s next for OSG in FY22?
We are working on integrating with Workday for a more streamlined disbursement process and to help applicants get their payments faster. This will also enable OSG Grants portal to become a fully end-to-end system, supporting users from submission to disbursement. 

We are also integrating Fraud Detection Platform (FDP), which is a WOG intelligence platform that enables agencies to conduct due diligence on grant applicants and counter fraud. This will improve the OSG Grants portal's fraud detection capabilities.

### What is the difference between grants on OurSG Grants portal and financial assistance schemes? 
The grants housed on OurSG Grants Portal are aimed at supporting Individuals and/or Organisations for specific purposes and for public benefit. Financial Assistance schemes, on the other hand, are meant to support individuals who require financial aid for matters which are personal to the individual. Due to their differing nature, these two types of schemes have very different business requirements and objectives, which OurSG Grants portal does not currently support
