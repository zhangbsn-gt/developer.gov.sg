<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>GovTech builds key digital platforms and infrastructure to support Singapore as a Smart Nation. As the economy becomes more digital, this includes the development of a National Digital Identity (NDI) to provide more convenience and security for residents when transacting online.</p>
<p>The NDI Platform is a digital infrastructure that serves as a common and universal trust framework which the public and private sectors can leverage to build value-added digital services. We want to work with industry to co-create innovative solutions that can boost business productivity and deliver better customer experiences.</p>

<h4>NDI Developer and Partner Portal</h4>
<p>The NDI Developer and Partner Portal, also known as NDI-API, gives you access to the information and tools to experiment, build and test solutions quickly and securely.</p>
<p>Here, you can access NDI API specifications, use the online tutorials to guide development of your applications or use the sandbox to visualise your new customer journeys. The portal also allows businesses with a valid CorpPass account to submit link-up requests for selected APIs, and on-board your business use cases.</p>
<p>Here are the four distinct layers in The Singapore NDI stack.</p>
<br>
<h6>Trusted Data</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Consists of verified data from authoritative sources. e.g. MyInfo personal data platform</li>
    <li>Brings greater convenience to residents by pre-filling online forms with government verified data and reducing the need to submit supporting documents in online transactions</li>
    <li>Improves data quality which increases business efficiency in verifying customers</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Trusted Identity</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Puts in place a National Certificate Authority (NCA) that will issue each resident with an unique digital identity</li>
    <li>Provides authentication services for both public and private sector digital services</li>
    <li>Built on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) cryptographic security techniques</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Trusted Access</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Puts in place legislative guidelines, technical references, operating models and cybersecurity standards that are consistent with industry and international practices</li>
    <li>Supports open and federated access, consisting of government, private or commercial Authentication Service Providers (ASP)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h6>Trusted Services</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Facilitate the development of new opportunities or value-added services, leveraging the other three layers of the NDI Stack, for better business efficiencies and more intuitive user experience</li>
    <li>E.g. Digital signing, which will allow businesses to create, sign and validate contracts more efficiently and securely</li>
</ul>
