### How Do You Use WOGAA?

- **WOGAA Uptime:** To use WOGAA Uptime, users can subscribe for email and/or SMS notifications via WOGAA. This allows users to be notified via their preferred platform once downtime occurs.
- **WOGAA Inspect:** WOGAA Inspect provides a dashboard for viewing the Performance, Accessibility, Best Practice and Searchability/Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) scores of an agencies' digital service. Users can also view actionable recommendations to improve the scores of each component as well or generate a report for further analysis.
- **WOGAA Analytics:** WOGAA Analytics presents data such as visits, page views, bounce rate, visit duration etc in a consolidated dashboard that can be viewed collectively.
- **WOGAA Sentiments:** Users can customise the questions, positioning, colours and choose from a selection of designs to ensure the widget matches the page. Once the public leaves user feedback on the relevant services, WOGAA Sentiments presents the scores against a 6-point scale rating in a dashboard, allowing users to view a breakdown of all audience ratings and feedback or download a report containing qualitative and quantitative Sentiments data for further analysis. Users can also subscribe to the Sentiments report to receive daily or weekly user feedback straight to their email inboxes.
