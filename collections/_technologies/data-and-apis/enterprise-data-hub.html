<p>The Enterprise Data Hub (EDH) is an inter-agency data-sharing platform that
    provides public officers with easy access to verified, identifiable business
    data.</p>
<p>You can use it to verify the legitimacy of a business, learn about a
    company’s profile and the government support it has received, and
    cross-reference agency data with datasets on the EDH for new insights.</p>
<p>Currently, datasets from the Ministry of Manpower, Inland Revenue Authority
    of Singapore, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, and Central
    Provident Fund Board are available.</p>
