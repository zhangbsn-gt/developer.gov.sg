### Overview

Based on the Smart Nation initiative, digital technologies and innovation will be key drivers of the Singapore economy and the Government will serve and respond to citizen needs through digital and smart technologies.

Thus, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has launched the [Land Transport DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html){:target="_blank"}, a platform that contains land transport-related datasets and APIs for enterprises, third-party developers, researchers and other members of the public to utilise. This is aimed at promoting collaboration and co-creation of innovative and inclusive transport solutions between the public and Government.

DataMall contains dynamic and static datasets. Dynamic datasets are updated in real time and served out via APIs which are accessible with an Account Key that are issued only to registered DataMall subscribers. Both dynamic and static datasets are collated from multiple sources. To view the full list of static datasets click here, and to view the full list of dynamic datasets click here.

Examples of available datasets include:
- Geospatial datasets: These provide Geographical Information System (GIS) information which are available in the ESRI Shape file format
- Facts & figures datasets: These provide land transport statistical reports which are available in both PDF and XLS format and updated on a monthly/annual basis.

In addition to datasets, DataMall also contains an App Zone. This is a marketplace of land transport applications developed by third parties and LTA for transport related services that cover bus arrival times, live traffic conditions, parking availability around the central business district (CBD) and taxi booking services among others.

### Why Should Land Transport DataMall be adopted? 

DataMall is the only land transport services focused data and API platform by the Singapore Government. It encourages open innovation between the public and private sector to collectively solve and improve our land transport services.
