The Government provides many services and information for businesses, which spans multiple agencies and platforms.

Developed by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), Ministry of Trade & Industry (MTI) and Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), GoBusiness represents the Government’s commitment to provide easy-to use, seamless, and relevant services for businesses, and to create a more pro-enterprise environment for businesses in Singapore.

-	**Keep track of their applications**: Businesses are kept up-to-date on their licence application status via the dashboard, and will be prompted if any action is required. 

-	**Receive personalised recommendations**: Businesses can receive a range of tailored recommendations via the dashboard. The Government Assistance e-Adviser considers a business’ unique profile when providing suggestions for relevant grants. 

These features will be introduced progressively from early 2022.
