### Overview

Identiface is a secure, user-friendly and convenient way to verify a person’s identity and genuine presence using a face scan that is compared against the Government’s biometric database (such as their latest NRIC, Passport, or Work Pass photo).  

Identiface is part of Singapore’s [National Digital Identity (NDI)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/digital-identity/national-digital-identity.html){:target="_blank"} initiative that provides a common and universal trust framework for the public and private sectors to leverage and build value-added services.

### What is Identiface?

Identiface is a secure authentication method that enables Singapore citizens and residents to access digital services on desktop or mobile devices conveniently using a face scan that is compared against the Government’s biometric database (such as their latest NRIC/Passport/ Work Pass photo). 

It allows businesses an additional or alternative way of verifying a person’s identity and genuine presence through consent-based and secure facial scanning. 

### Why Should Identiface be Adopted?

The main benefits of Identiface are:
-	**Cost-savings and efficiency**: Businesses do not need to enroll customers or build, secure and maintain a biometric database and system from scratch. Integration is achieved easily through bundled SDKs and APIs and face scans are compared against the government’s biometrics data source
-	**Security**: Identiface has fraud detection technology to protect against impersonation attempts. It can be layered upon existing authentication process to enable multi-factor authentication and provide a higher identity assurance, especially for transactions involving sensitive information or high transaction value
-	**Usability**: Users only need to provide their NRIC/FIN number and consent to start the authentication process. User verification is simplified especially for the elderly and less tech savvy users.

### How Do You Use Identiface?

**For end-users**: Users simply enter their Singpass ID and password, followed by scanning their face on an Internet-enabled computer with a web camera or a mobile device with a front-facing camera. Users without such devices can also visit selected public locations (like IRAS Taxpayer and Business Service Centre and Our Tampines’ Hub Public Service Centre) equipped with this service.

### Success Stories

Identiface is being piloted for logins to government digital services at kiosks located at IRAS Taxpayer and Business Service Centre and Our Tampines Hub’s Public Service Centre since April 2020, and CPF’s Customer Service Centre since September 2020. Over 81,000 access to services at these kiosks have been verified through the Face Verification feature. Users who visit the service centres to reset their Singpass passwords have also seen a reduction in waiting time of over 10 minutes as the technology offers improved convenience and ease of use.

"_Our staff and users found the Singpass face verification useful and helpful with the following benefits: convenient login process, shorter time to login, an alternative for users who forgot password..._"<br>**- Senior Manager, Service Centre at Central Provident Fund Board**

Identiface has also improved registration processes of businesses. For example, DBS bank adopted Identiface to make its digital banking registration process more intuitive and seamless. One out of four DBS customers now choose Identiface to complete their verification process.
