### Overview

Projections estimate that the number of seniors living alone in Singapore will reach 83,000 by 2030. This is a steep increase from 47,000 in 2016. Surveys show that most seniors prefer to live in their own home rather than elsewhere, such as nursing homes. However, seniors are also anxious about whether they can live safely and independently by themselves. For example, they might be worried that no one will come to their aid when they experience medical emergencies at home. 

In response, PAB was conceived to ensure that seniors living alone can remain safe and independent. PAB is part of the [Government Assisted Living Ecosystem (GALE)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/government-assisted-living-ecosystem){:target="_blank"}, a collection of technologies and services to give our seniors greater peace of mind and support during their golden years.

### What is the PAB?

PAB is an alert device that can be installed in an elderly’s home. When a senior in distress activates the PAB, a distress signal will be sent to either a [Senior Activity Centre (SAC)](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/8/senior_activity_centre){:target="_blank"} or [CareLine](https://www.singhealth.com.sg/rhs/live-well/CareLine/about-us){:target="_blank"}, which is a 24-hour telecare service provided by Changi General Hospital (CGH).

Upon receiving a distress alert from the PAB, staff will triage the situation and respond accordingly. The staff may communicate with the distressed senior using the PAB’s 4G technology which enables two-way communication, or use a 10 second audio recording to triage the situation within the household.

### Why Should the PAB be Adopted?

PAB is a fast and responsive device that enables our seniors to live safely and independently by providing round-the-clock monitoring and assistance. 

The seniors are allowed to determine the location* of the devices as they are wireless and battery-operated, with a lifespan of around five years.

_*To ensure that seniors can reach the PAB when they are on floor, there is a maximum height limit for installation of PABs._

### How Do You Use the PAB?

Use the PAB by following these steps:

1. **PRESS** the red button if you are in distress and need help. (Press the blue button on the side of the PAB to cancel the distress signal if you pressed the red button by accident.)
2. **TELL** the PAB what has happened. Your description will be recorded and sent to either an SAC or CareLine.
3. **WAIT** for SAC or CareLine staff to respond to you or visit your house to provide assistance.

### Success Stories

PABs have been installed in more than 6,000 housing units from 53 rental blocks.

Between November 2019 and September 2021, the PAB handled 415 emergency cases, including medical, social, and crime-related issues. Testimonies from two PAB users are as shown below:

_“From 9pm to 3am… my leg was so painful. I couldn’t get out of bed… I can’t walk so I pressed the button for help. My son lives in Woodlands, too far away from me. I would have taken a taxi ride to hospital myself, but at 3am… where can I find a taxi?”_ 
<br>**– Mdm A, a senior who lives alone**

_“I was feeling breathless, I can’t reach the phone. I can’t even tell the 995 phone operator my address even if I can walk to my phone. [Your system] no need to give address, they knew… and they sent the ambulance to me.”_ 
<br>**– Mr T, a senior who lives alone**

### What's Next?

The team is exploring opportunities to deploy the PAB beyond the current 53 rental blocks.
