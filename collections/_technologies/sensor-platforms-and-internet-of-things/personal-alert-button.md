## Overview
The Personal Alert Button (PAB) is an alert device that is currently ongoing deployment for 53 rental blocks in Singapore. 
The devices are installed within the senior’s household. When a distress senior triggers the alert device, it will route an alert to the senior 
activity centre (SAC) during office hours or to a 24/7 senior telecare call centre for triaging.

There are currently 10,000 seniors onboarded on GALE, as of 1st April 2021.
