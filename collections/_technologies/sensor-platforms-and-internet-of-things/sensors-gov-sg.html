<h2>Sensors.gov.sg Portal</h2>
<h3>What is Sensors.gov.sg?</h3>
<p>
  Sensors.gov.sg is a one-stop portal for government agencies, the private
  industry and citizens to access various Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) products and services. It also
  provides information on how agencies are utilising sensors in their
  operations.
</p>
<p>
  The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) is a Strategic National Project that
  provides whole-of-government products and services. These services allow
  agencies to collect, share and analyse sensor data, and manage IoT and
  robotics systems.
</p>
<p>
  SNSP aims to develop a 360° real-time view of Singapore with spatial-temporal
  sensor data. With these additional insights, government agencies, industries
  and citizens can make data-driven decisions to improve quality of life. SNSP
  collects 360° sensor data from both static and mobile sensor platforms as well
  as data exchange platforms.
</p>
<p>
  SNSP gives you the tools to visualise and act on sensor data in a searchable
  3D virtual environment, bridging the cyber-physical worlds for real-time
  situational awareness and action. For more information on SNSP’s platforms and
  services, visit the links below.
