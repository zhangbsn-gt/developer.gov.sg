<h2>Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP)</h2>
<h3>What is LaaP?</h3>
<p>
  The Lamppost-as-a-Platform (LaaP) project trials the effectiveness of
  lampposts as a key sensor infrastructure. If proven successful, the platform
  would augment the operational and planning capabilities of government
  agencies, including yours.
</p>
<p>
  As a commonplace feature of our urban environment, lampposts are reliable
  power sources that provide comprehensive coverage of the city. LaaP offers a
  common infrastructure and services for the various government agencies to
  collect, share and analyse real-time sensors and video data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  LaaP uses cloud-based infrastructure, wired and wireless technologies (e.g.
  low-bandwidth, low-powered wide area network connectivity). It is also fitted
  with intelligent sensors - including video, environmental and geolocation
  sensors.
</p>
<p>
  These capabilities help your government agency to translate sensor data – both
  within your domain of expertise and across multiple domains – providing you
  with greater situational awareness and actionable insights for operations and
  planning.
</p>
<h3>What are the features available?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Centralised device management:</strong> LaaP provides a
      centralised device management platform to monitor and manage the health
      status and configuration of devices at deployment sites.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Video/sensor data acquisition:</strong> LaaP supports various
      messaging protocols and connectivity to securely acquire sensor and video
      data from deployment sites.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Video/sensor data analytics:</strong> Sensor nodes at the edge
      fuse multiple sources of sensor data, with support for both front-end edge
      analytics and back-end video analytics.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Support for different IoT protocols: </strong>LaaP supports
      protocols such as DDS and MQTT.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>End-to-end security</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are some helpful use cases of LaaP?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Classification and Speed Detection of Personal Mobility Devices (PMD)
        and Bicycles</strong
      >
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our cameras are integrated with video analytic capabilities and fitted onto
  smart lampposts to:
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Classify PMDs and bicycles</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Detect their speed along footpaths, shared paths and cycling
          paths</strong
        >
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Detect if there are any PMDs travelling on roads.</strong>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Accuracy rates:</strong> At least 75% in the classification of PMDs
  and bicycles, and at least 80% in speed measurements.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Information Sharing with Vehicles (V2I – Vehicle to
        Infrastructure)</strong
      >
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  LaaP tests the use of environmental and geolocation sensors to enhance
  situational awareness of AVs and manned vehicles. On-board units (OBU) in
  vehicles will receive data from these sensors within 1.3 seconds, without any
  data loss.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Crowd Analytics</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  LaaP has a video analytics feature to understand crowd behaviour - counting
  the size of waiting crowds at pedestrian crossings and bus stops, the number
  and direction of crossings, and the waiting time between crossings.
</p>
<p>
  Government agencies can use these data to inform the design of public
  infrastructure, improve the urban living experience and provide more efficient
  transportation services.
</p>
<p>
  Operators can also set occupancy thresholds to trigger automated alerts when
  thresholds are breached.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Accuracy rates:</strong> At least 75% in footfall count and occupancy,
  and at least 75% accuracy rate in crossing count and wait time
  calculation.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Verifying Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal interference
        and integrity</strong
      >
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  LaaP can verify any interference to GNSS signals and maintain their integrity
  by collecting GNSS information from sensors mounted on lampposts or roadside
  infrastructure. The four types of GNSS signals commonly used in detection and
  for collection are:
  <em>GPS L1, GLONASS L1, Galileo E1 and BeiDou B1</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Success rates:</strong> At least 95% of the time. Transmission of the
  4 types of GNSS signals - from the GNSS receiver to the backend cloud
  application, and getting published within 2 seconds.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It also simulates and publishes the spoofed and/or jammed signals within 2
  minutes from the start of the simulation to the backend cloud application. It
  will continuously publish the data until the end of the simulation.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Localised Environment Monitoring</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  LaaP uses environmental sensors to collect localised environmental data for
  agencies’ use in urban planning. These localised data enable agencies to
  design better living and workspaces around environmental factors, e.g.
  direction, the flow of wind, the direction of sun’s rays, rainfall and air
  quality.
</p>

  respective sensor types are represented in the following table:
