<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  IoT refers to the concept of numerous devices being connected to the Internet, allowing data about the physical world to be collected, analysed and used for    decision-making. IoT has been adopted in many areas, from consumer-focused to industrial sectors, and the Government is no exception.
</p>
<p>
  DECADA (Device Management, Control and Data Acquisition Systems) was initially conceived as a centralized cloud platform for Government IoT systems. It has since been developed into more components, which together form the IoT Tech Stack.
</p>

<h2>What is the IoT Tech Stack?</h2>

<p>
  The IoT Tech Stack is a set of tools and services for sensors and IoT applications and is also known as DECADA. It consists of three core components, which facilitate the acquisition and exchange of data from sensors to the cloud. Agencies can use DECADA to easily develop and run IoT applications.
</p>
<p>
  The three core components of the IoT Tech Stack are as shown below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.siot.gov.sg/core-products/decada-embedded/" target="_blank"
      >DECADA Embedded</a
      > (formerly known as MANUCA): This is a family of microcontroller-class devices that can communicate directly to DECADA Cloud. DECADA Embedded provides software reference designs for onboarding and communication with DECADA Cloud. Hence, developers can add custom application logic for their use cases and quickly have a ready-to-deploy embedded device.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.siot.gov.sg/core-products/decada-edge/" target="_blank"
      >DECADA Edge Gateway</a
      >: A product and software solution to onboard new and existing sensor nodes to DECADA easily and securely. It is both a <b>gateway</b> to DECADA Cloud, and an <b>edge device</b> to process and aggregate sensor nodes data to reduce data traffic to the cloud. Agencies can make use of its web user interface to allow for various combinations of sensor nodes connection and data processing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.siot.gov.sg/core-products/decada-cloud/" target="_blank"
      >DECADA Cloud</a
      >: A multi-tenant cloud platform deployed on the
    <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-commercial-cloud" target="_blank"
      >Government Commercial Cloud</a
      >. DECADA Cloud’s features include asset management, data acquisition, event triggers, stream processing, data analytics, report generation and APIs for querying data.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the IoT Tech Stack?</h2>

<p>
  As digital services become an integral part of everyday life, there is a need for these services to be easy to use, adaptable and relevant. This means that digital services must be technologically advanced and streamlined to meet the needs of today’s highly digitalised era.
</p>
<p>
  While most agencies develop their own services and infrastructure to cater to the needs of specific citizens or business groups that they serve, this may not be the most cost-friendly or time-efficient way.
</p>
<p>
  GovTech’s IoT Tech Stack allows agencies and developers to achieve the above by enabling quick and cost-efficient development and deployment of IoT-related applications, and easy exchange of data across the government. This aggregates data collection for richer insights that would in turn help develop policy and monitor operations.
</p>

<h2>How do You Use the IoT Tech Stack?</h2>
  
<p>
  GovTech provides an easy-to-use starter kit for software developers interested in making use of the IoT Tech Stack for their agencies. It is designed to get developers started with sending data from an embedded device, DECADA Embedded, to the government IoT cloud, DECADA Cloud. This kit was used in both the
  <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/events/stack-x-conference" target="_blank"
      >STACK-X 2019</a
    > and
  <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/communities/events/stack-2020" target="_blank"
      >STACK2020</a
    > conference workshops. To find out more about the SIOT Starter kit, click

      >here</a
    >. Apart from the physical components, the starter kit also contains a walkthrough guide on how to get started.

<h2>Success Stories</h2>
  
  <p>
    Various projects including the <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/personal-alert-button">Personal Alert Button system</a>, Smart Office and <a href="https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/safeentry.html">SafeEntry Gateways</a> have been developed using DECADA and are currently operational on DECADA.
