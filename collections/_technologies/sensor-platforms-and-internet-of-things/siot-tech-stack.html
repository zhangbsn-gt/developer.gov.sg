<p>
  To enable government agencies to build services quickly and effectively,
  GovTech has developed the

    target="_blank"
    >Singapore Government Tech Stack</a
  >
  (SGTS). Traditionally, most agencies develop their own services and
  infrastructure to meet the needs of the specific citizen or business group
  they serve, and may not be the fastest or most efficient way. With SGTS,
  agencies would be able to tap on a suite of tools and services hosted on a
  common infrastructure to ensure consistency, security and high quality of
  their applications.
</p>
<p>
  Agencies can focus on designing solutions that best meet the needs of those
  they serve, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Citizens can
  expect a more secure, seamless, consistent and connected user experience
  across the spectrum of government digital services.

<p>The Sensors and IoT stack consists of 3 core components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a
      href="https://www.siot.gov.sg/tech-stack/manuca/overview/"
      target="_blank"
      >MANUCA</a
    >: a family of low power data acquisition products designed to integrate
    multiple low-bandwidth sensors and publish their measure points to DECADA
    Cloud swiftly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.siot.gov.sg/tech-stack/decada-edge/" target="_blank"
      >DECADA Edge Gateway</a
    >: a product and software solution to onboard new and existing sensor nodes
    to DECADA securely with ease. It is both a Gateway to DECADA and an Edge to
    process and aggregate sensor nodes data to reduce data traffic to DECADA.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.siot.gov.sg/tech-stack/decada-cloud/" target="_blank"
      >DECADA</a
    >: a multi-tenant cloud platform that provides support for device
    management, data acquisition and data analytics of IoT devices.
  </li>
</ul>
