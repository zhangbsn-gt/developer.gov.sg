<h3>What is Sensesurround?</h3>
<p>
  Sensesurround is a command and control (C2) platform that translates real-time
  sensor data into a searchable, actionable 3D digital world.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>What are the features available?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Real-time digital environment</strong> - By ingesting and fusing
      different spatial-temporal datasets, Sensesurround is able to present a
      real-time 3D digital environment that reflects what is happening in
      Singapore at any time and location.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Search by parameters</strong> - Search this 3D environment by
      dataset, data type, location or other parameters to gain new insights for
      planning and operations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Optimised for efficient use</strong> - Sensesurround streamlines
      processes and optimises efficiency, with automated workflows for
      notification and actuation.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  With a real-time 360º view of Singapore that allows operators to act in
  real-time, Sensesurround represents the future of digital operations.
</p>
<h3>What sub-products does it have?</h3>
<p>
  Sensesurround consists of several sub-products that provide different
  capabilities and services to government agencies, the private sector and
  citizens:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>

      <a
        href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/sensor-asset-management"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
        ><u>Sensor Asset Management (SAM)</u></a
      >
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Sensor Asset Management (SAM) is a web-based portal for registering and
  sharing sensor and robotic assets, providing a holistic overview of the sensor
  landscape in Singapore on a real-time 3D map.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/senseops"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
        ><u>SENSEOPS Dashboard</u></a
      >
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Developed using Sensesurround technology, SENSEOPS is an operations map and
  dashboard for COVID-19. SENSEOPS, which features both map and dashboard
  layers, was designed to help enhance situational awareness and operational
  efficiency to aid agencies in their COVID-19 efforts.
</p>
<h3>How can I get started?</h3>
<p>
  GovTech is currently working with government agencies to use SAM and SENSEOPS
  for their operational needs. To work with us, contact
