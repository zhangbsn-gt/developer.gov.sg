description: >
  HealthCerts schema was developed in collaboration with Government Technology
  Agency(GovTech) and Ministry of Health(MOH), Singapore which is a set of
  digital standards and schema for issuing COVID-19
  test results/vaccination certificates that are in line with international standards and the
  Singapore Government's requirements.

<h2>HealthCerts</h2>
<p>
  For most countries, an extensive vaccination process is underway.
There are ongoing discussions how vaccine-certificates can be part of the
effort to reopen the global economy and enable cross-border travel. There is a
need to collaborate amongst governments to support cross border prospects that
provide global solutions.
</p>
<p>
  We published <a href="https://healthcerts.gov.sg">HealthCerts</a> - a set of
  digital open standards and schema for issuing digital COVID-19 test results/
  vaccination certificates, in line with international standards and the Singapore Government's requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>HealthCerts is designed to support an open ecosystem and
      public-private partnerships. Singapore welcomes partners to further the
      work in this space, including further enhancing interoperability, privacy,
      and verifiability of digital certificates. Please contact us at info@tech.gov.sg should you have further queries. </strong>

     <h2>About HealthCerts</h2>
  <h3 id="what-is-healthcert">What is HealthCerts?</h3>
      <p>
        HealthCerts is a set of digital open standards and schema for issuing
        digital COVID-19 test results/ vaccination certificates, in line with
        international standards and the Singapore Government's requirements.
        This will allow the global community to collectively improve it so that
        governments and public health authorities may adapt it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) in collaboration
        with the Ministry of Health (MOH), the use of HealthCerts to enable an interoperable, verifiable, and tamper-proof solution which will smoothen and expedite check-in processing and customs clearance at foreign and local immigration checkpoints.
        </p>

            alt="Using HealthCerts,Not&alpha;rise and Verify"/>
            </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>HealthCerts</strong> is interoperable with private sector
          solutions such as the Affinidi Unifier app. These certificates are also
          tamper-proof (data stored is immutable) and secure, protected against
          unauthorised access. The digital certificate stores identity details
          (name, national identity number, DOB etc.) and test details (type, status, date, medical institution details).
        </p>
        <p>
          For added assurance, digital certificates may be digitally authenticated
          and endorsed by the Government through <strong>Not&alpha;rise</strong> to ease downstream verification.
          <strong>Verify</strong> provides an easy, reliable way to ensures digital certificates
          have not been tampered with and issued/digitally authenticated and endorsed by a recognised entity.

<h2>Integration and Interoperability</h2>
    <h3 id="technical-resources">Technical resources to issue, verify or store digital certificates</h3>
    <h4> Issue a Health Certificate</h4>
    <p>
       The HealthCerts schema has been published <a href="https://www.healthcerts.gov.sg/schema/">here</a>. All digital pre-departure
       test results issued in Singapore shall comprise of the data elements defined
       in the schema. During presentation, these are the minimum data types that need
       to be displayed.
    </p>
    <ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Data fields as defined in <a href="https://schemata.openattestation.com/">schema</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>QR code which shall contain the following components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>A link to fetch the HealthCerts.</p></li>
      <li><p>Decryption key to decrypt HealthCerts payload.</p></li>
      <li><p>URL to perform verification of HealthCerts.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Encryption shall be based performed using <a href="https://github.com/Open-Attestation/oa-encryption/blob/master/src/index.ts">oa-encrypt</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      QR code shall be readable by any standard QR code reader (non-proprietary
      formatting).
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This requirement for shall apply to the various modes of certificate delivery,
  which could include sharing via:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HealthCerts document or email which contains the memo and QR code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Mobile application which renders the HealthCerts document as a
      decentralised document.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<figure style="text-align: center">
  <img
    src="/assets/img/github-repo.png"
    alt="Github repo"/>
</figure>
<p>
  The purpose of the decentralised document renderer is to allow OpenAttestation
  (OA) document issuers to style their documents without code change to the different
  implementations of the document viewer. It does so by embedding the website specified
  by the document issuers as an iframe or webview (for mobile apps) and sending the content
  of the OA document into the iframe. More details can be found <a href="https://github.com/Open-Attestation/adr/blob/master/decentralised_rendering.md">here</a>.
</p>
<h4> Authenticate, Endorse and Verify a Health Certificate</h4>
<p>
  For added assurance, Digital Certificates may be digitally authenticated and endorsed by the
  Government through <strong>Not&alpha;rise</strong> to ease downstream verification by ensuring:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Untampered content - Authenticate the veracity of the Digital Certificate
      against blockchain hash value.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Trusted provenance - Verify the legitimacy of Digital Certificate
      according to our travel policy requirements and checks that the
      laboratory (or clinic) is authorised to issue Digital Certificates.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Rightful ownership - Stronger identity assurance when presented on the Singpass app for prevention against impersonation.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To authenticate and endorse a digital certificate for recognition at the airport and overseas, travellers will need to visit Not&alpha;rise <a href= "https://www.notarise.gov.sg">(https://www.notarise.gov.sg)</a>
  and upload their digital document. Upon successful authentication and endorsement, travellers will receive a digital certificate containing a QR code through email, and/ or via Singpass app (see below for a sample). Authenticated and endorsed digital certificates using the HealthCerts schema are issued by Singapore’s Ministry of Health which will be recognised overseas
  </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      <strong>Verify</strong> provides an easy, reliable way to ensures digital
      certificates have not been tampered with and issued/ authenticated and endorsed by a recognised
      entity. Verify’s open-source information can be found at <a
        href="https://github.com/Open-Attestation/verify.gov.sg">https://github.com/Open-Attestation/verify.gov.sg</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>We welcome private sector entities develop their own versions of Verify
        with their own list of recognised COVID labs or foreign authorities.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Existing private sector use case such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Affinidi Unifier app </strong>provides document verification
          services for attesting document authenticity and validation to airlines
          and airports. This is similar to Verify.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          IATA conducts verification against the rules engine of other countries to
          determine if the test certificate meets the destination country
          requirements.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Store a Health Certificate (Digital Wallets)</h4>
    <p>
      We have open-sourced the reference implementation to store and share
      HealthCerts on mobile wallets -
      <a href="https://github.com/Open-Attestation/identity-wallet">https://github.com/Open-Attestation/identity-wallet</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Accredify</strong> provides a Digital Health Passport to store,
          display and share HealthCerts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
