description: >
  HealthCerts schema was developed in collaboration with Government Technology
  Agency(GovTech) and Ministry of Health(MOH), Singapore which is a set of
  digital standards and schema for issuing COVID-19
  test results/vaccination certificates that are in line with international standards and the
  Singapore Government's requirements.

<h2>HealthCerts</h2>
<p>
  For most countries, an extensive vaccination process is underway.
There are ongoing discussions how vaccine-certificates can be part of the
effort to reopen the global economy and enable cross-border travel. There is a
need to collaborate amongst governments to support cross border prospects that
provide global solutions.
</p>
<p>
  We published <a href="https://healthcerts.gov.sg">HealthCerts</a> - a set of
  digital open standards and schema for issuing digital COVID-19 test results/
  vaccination certificates, in line with international standards and the Singapore
  Government's requirements. This will allow the global community to collectively
  improve it so that governments and public health authorities may adapt it. Besides
  the standards and schema, it is useful to understand in greater detail how the
  solution works and some of the limitations to be taken note of.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together with HealthCerts,<a href="https://notarise.gov.sg"> Notarise</a> was also developed to digitally notarise certificates
    and <a href="https://verify.gov.sg">Verify</a> to enable authorities to confirm certificates' legitimacy as shown
    in Figure 1 below.

<h3>Digital Vaccine-Certificates in Singapore</h3>
<p>
  The Government Technology Agency(GovTech), in collaboration with the Singapore
  Health Ministry have developed a system for issuing, authenticating and verifying
  digital certificates shown in Figure 2 below. It ensures certificates issues are
  tamper-proof, secure and comply with international standards and the Singapore
  Government's requirements.

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>
  HealthCerts is a set of digital open standards and schema for issuing,
  authenticating and verifying digital COVID-19 test results/vaccination certificates.
  HealthCerts are issued in line with international standards
  and the Singapore Government's requirements. It is interoperable with private
  sector solutions. These certificates are also tamper-proof(data stored is immutable)
  and secure, protected against unauthorised access.
  </p>
  <p>
    The digital certificate stores identity details (name, national identity numnber, DOB etc.)
    and test details (type, status, date, medical institution details). The QR
    Code will be sent via email or presented under the SingPass Mobile app as shown
    in Figure 3 below.
    </p>

      />

  <p>
    HealthCerts is powered by <a href="https://www.openattestation.com/">OpenAttestation</a>,
    an open-source framework using blockchain to issue cryptographically trustworthy
    documents which can be verified independently without the need for proprietary
    software equipment.
    <p>
  For added assurance, Digital Certificates may be digitally notarized by the
  Government through Notarise to ease downstream verification
  by ensuring:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Untampered content - Authenticate the veracity of the Digital Certificate
      against blockchain hash value
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Trusted provenance - Verify the legitimacy of Digital Certificate
      according to our travel policy requirements and checks that the&nbsp;
      laboratory (or clinic) is authorised to issue Digital Certificates
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Rightful ownership - Strong identity assurance<strong> </strong>through
      SingPass to prevent impersonation
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Verify provides an easy, reliable way to ensures digital certificates have
  not been tampered with and issued/ notarised by a recognised entity.
  </p>
  <p>
<h3>Global Interoperability</h3>
<p>
  To support the opening of cross-border travel, there is a need to verify
  travellers’ identity and their associated health status.
  </p>
  <p>
  We have therefore designed HealthCerts with global interoperability in mind as an open standard.
  Entities can sign up to issue digital certificates compliant with the
  HealthCerts standard. At the moment, AOKpass, Accredify. Collinson and Trybe.ID
  provide issuance service to clinics and labs such as Quest Laboratories,
  Gleneagles Hospital and Parkway Shenton Medical Group in Singapore and
  overseas countries.
</p>
<p>
  As Verify is open sourced, private companies or governments can develop their
  own versions of Verify, with their own list of recognised COVID labs or foreign
  authorities. Private sector offerings:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Affinidi provides document verification services for attesting document
      authenticity and validation to airlines &amp; airports.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      IATA conducts verification against the rules engine of other countries to
      determine if the test certificate meets the destination country
      requirements.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Singapore welcomes working with partners to further the work in this space,
  including further enhancing interoperability, privacy, and verifiability for
  such certificates.
