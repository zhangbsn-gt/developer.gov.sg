<p>
  To meet the new, rapidly evolving challenges that have emerged
  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore has leveraged
  its technological capabilities to develop a suite of
  innovative digital solutions.

<p>
  By tapping on engineering capabilities to build on its
  existing digital infrastructure, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech)
  has been able to swiftly roll out a wide variety of digital tools
  to aid and complement our nation’s strategic response to the pandemic.
  In designing these tools, developers were guided by three important underlying principles:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The technology had to be based on <b>sound public health principles</b>
      and <b>informed by the needs of health authorities</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Accountability</b> to the public through
      <b>transparency of data collection and usage</b> had to be ensured
      </li>
    <li>
      These solutions had to be <b>accessible even to non-digital natives</b>,
      with <b>alternatives</b> provided for the <b>digitally excluded and under-served
      segments</b> where necessary.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Timely and targeted solutions—adhering to this design philosophy—have
  been created for each unique need that has arisen due to the pandemic.
  Here are some of the tools that we have developed to meet these needs.

        <h4>SafeEntry – Combating Clusters through Check-Ins</h4>
        <p>
          Developed by GovTech,
          <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/safeentry">SafeEntry</a>
          is a national digital check-in system that logs identifying details of individuals
          (identification card and mobile numbers) visiting public venues such as malls and workplaces,
          as well as communal activity areas.

        <p>
          <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/tracetogether">TraceTogether</a>
          is a mobile application (available on Android and iOS devices) that was developed by GovTech’s
          <a href="https://www.hive.gov.sg/">Government Digital Services</a> team
          and the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/">Ministry of Health</a>
          to complement manual contact tracing efforts.

        <h4>SPOTON – Smart Thermal Scanning</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/spoton">SPOTON</a>
          is a smart thermal scanner that was created by GovTech’s
          <a href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things">
            Smart Nation Platform Solutions (SNPS)</a> team.
          With SPOTON, fast crowd temperature screening is enabled by detecting and
          alerting operators to individuals with high temperatures.
          This minimises physical contact and time spent on manual temperature checks.

          <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/supplyally">SupplyAlly</a>
          is a mobile app that facilitates the process of logistics distribution during COVID-19.
          The app serves as a single solution for both the management of a flexible pool
          of supply-distributing volunteers, as well as the tracking of collection quotas.

        <h4>VigilantGantry - Access Control with AI and Video Analytics</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/vigilantgantry">VigilantGantry</a>
          is a fully automated, contactless gantry system for
          temperature screening developed by GovTech’s
          Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID).
          Driven by AI and deep learning, it augments existing thermal scanners
          to improve the rate of contactless scanning, ease bottlenecks in long queues
          outside buildings and reduce manpower required for temperature screening measures.
