<p>
  To meet the new, rapidly evolving challenges that have emerged 
  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore has leveraged 
  its technological capabilities to develop a suite of 
  innovative digital solutions.
</p>
<p>
  By tapping on engineering capabilities to build on its 
  existing digital infrastructure, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) 
  has been able to swiftly roll out a wide variety of digital tools 
  to aid and complement our nation’s strategic response to the pandemic. 
  In designing these tools, developers were guided by three important underlying principles:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The technology had to be based on <b>sound public health principles</b> 
      and <b>informed by the needs of health authorities</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Accountability</b> to the public through
      <b>transparency of data collection and usage</b> had to be ensured
      </li>
    <li>
      Tools had to be <b>readily adaptable</b> and <b>versatile</b> 
      to keep up with the ever-evolving pandemic
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Timely and targeted solutions—adhering to this design philosophy—have 
  been created for each unique need that has arisen due to the pandemic. 
  Here are some of the tools that we have developed to meet these needs.

          <a href="/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/safeentry">SafeEntry</a> 
          is a national digital check-in system that logs identifying details of individuals 
          (identification card and mobile numbers) visiting public venues such as malls and workplaces, 
          as well as communal activity areas.
