  GoWhere Suite is an end-to-end distribution stack that facilitates COVID-19 communications and operations.
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  The GoWhere Suite is a ground-up initiative by GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS) team. It was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and addresses the need for a rapid and reliable source of information. It also supports location/eligibility-based information queries/discoveries, functions as an inclusive mass media channel and provides OpsTech integration to support Government distribution operations. Currently, GoWhere Suite exists as a mini-stack, featuring various government portals and has been used in 14 Government initiatives which boasts 25.4 million website visits.
</p>

<h2>Why Should the GoWhere Suite be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  The COVID-19 pandemic was (and continues to be) volatile and rapidly evolving. This meant that the guidelines and measures in response to the pandemic were also constantly being updated. Furthermore, the extensive impact of COVID-19 necessitated response measures that cuts across many Government agencies. As a result, individuals and businesses found it difficult to keep up with the latest information and it was taxing for them to gather information from multiple agencies. As a one-stop resource hub for all COVID-19 related information, GoWhere Directory facilitates citizens and businesses to access rapid and reliable information during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
  The pandemic also necessitated unprecedented nationwide distribution efforts. GoWhere’s suite of websites, such as ARTGoWhere and TokenGoWhere, facilitates these nationwide distribution efforts using location-based information queries/discoveries.
</p>

<h2> What's Next?</h2>
  <p>Beyond the Covid-19 pandemic, GoWhere suite intends to continue providing up-to-date official information to Singapore residents. The application stack of GoWhere Suite is relevant to any generic distribution operations or a location/eligibility-based query information system.</p>
<p>Government agencies and organisations such as the <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/">Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)</a>, <a href="https://www.ncss.gov.sg/">National Council of Social Service (NCSS)</a>, <a href="https://www.sgenable.sg/Pages/Home.aspx">SG Enable (SGE)</a>, and <a href="https://www.aic.sg/">Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)</a> are exploring the expansion of <a href="https://supportgowhere.life.gov.sg/">SupportGoWhere</a> as a one-stop social assistance portal. This could transform the delivery of social services.</p>
