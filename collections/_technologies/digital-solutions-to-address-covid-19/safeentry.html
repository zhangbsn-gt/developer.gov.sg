  SafeEntry - Combating Clusters through Check-Ins
</h2>
<p>
  As more activities and services gradually resume following the circuit breaker period,
  it is important to put in place efforts to prevent and control the transmission of
  COVID-19 such as contact tracing and quicker identification of COVID-19 clusters.
</p>
<p>
  Developed by GovTech, SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs
  identifying details of individuals (identification card and mobile numbers)
  visiting public venues such as malls and workplaces, as well as communal activity areas.
  SafeEntry helps support and quicken efforts by providing authorities with a record of
  individuals who enter and exit these places.
</p>
<p>
  These records will reduce the time needed to identify potential close contacts of
  COVID-19 patients and clusters. We encourage everyone to use SafeEntry to check-in
  and check-out when going about your daily activities.
</p>
<p>SafeEntry has integrated with the
    TraceTogether app. Users can scan the SafeEntry QR code and check-in without entering
    their details manually.
</p>
<h3>How is my data protected?</h3>
<p>
  The data collected via SafeEntry is encrypted and stored in the Government server
  and is retained for 25 days, which is the necessary retention period to support MOH's
  contact tracing efforts, and will be purged thereafter. It can only be used to
  carry out or facilitate contact tracing, except when there is a need to use data
  for criminal investigations and proceedings into seven categories of serious offences.
  The data may also be de-identified and aggregated for analytics purposes.
</p>
<p>There are stringent measures in place to safeguard the personal data. Only authorised
public officers will have access to the data. Under the Public Sector (Governance) Act,
public officers who recklessly or knowingly disclose the data without authorisation
or misuse the data may be liable to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up
to two years, or both.</p>
<h3>What is the SafeEntry Location Matching Self-Check Service?</h3>
<p>
  The SafeEntry Location Matching Self-Check Service helps members of the public
  recall if they had previously been at the locations visited by COVID-19 cases.
  The service allows users to check if they had been in proximity to someone
  with COVID-19. Additionally, SMS alerts are sent to those who were at
  locations assessed to pose a higher risk of transmission at the same time as
  COVID-19 cases.
</p>
<p>
  This service was launched following public feedback. It is intended as a
  precautionary measure for users, and does not replace existing contract
  tracing protocols.
</p>
<h3>How does the self-check service work?</h3>
<p>
  The service matches users’ SafeEntry records against the locations and timings
  of visits by COVID-19 cases to public places, which are announced by the
  Ministry of Health.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Making better sense of MOH’s information</strong>. The Self-Check
      service is meant to complement MOH’s announcement of public locations
      visited by COVID-19 cases (for more than 30 minutes during their
      infectious period).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Helping users assess possible exposure</strong>. By providing
      individuals who were at the same mall or building (based on their
      SafeEntry records captured at different locations within the mall or
      building), it will help them to recall if they had been near the
      location(s) visited by the COVID-19 case.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Multiple front-ends to self-check</strong>: Users are able to
      access to self-check their matches via the TraceTogether app or on the SafeEntry
      <a
        href="https://wereyouthere.safeentry.gov.sg/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
        >website</a
      >. For those wishing to use the self-check service but without access to
      smartphones or computers, they may seek assistance with the SafeEntry
      Self-Check Service from Citizens Connect Centres located at Our Tampines
      Hub and 26 community centres island-wide.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How does the SMS notification service work?</h3>
<p>
  In addition to a self-check service, SMS notifications are also sent to a smaller group of individuals who were at
  locations that are assessed to pose a higher risk of transmission, such as
  dining places and gyms where people do not wear masks for extended periods of
  time.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Individuals who receive the SMS notification are advised to monitor
        their health closely for 14 days from the date of the match</strong
      >.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>How are the mobile numbers used to send SMS kept updated?</strong>
      The service utilises the most current mobile phone number provided by the
      user, across different channels depending on the mode used for check-in.

<h3>How are potential matches determined?</h3>
<p>
  <strong
        >Those using the Location Matching Self-Check Service or receiving SMS notifications are only shown
        SafeEntry records that are matched as a possible COVID-19
        exposure</strong
      >. The diagram below explains the criteria used to determine a user’s
      possible exposure matches:
