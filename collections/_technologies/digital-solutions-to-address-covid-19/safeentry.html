  SafeEntry - Combating Clusters through Check-Ins
</h2>
<p>
  As more activities and services gradually resume following the circuit breaker period, 
  it is important to put in place efforts to prevent and control the transmission of 
  COVID-19 such as contact tracing and quicker identification of COVID-19 clusters. 
</p>
<p>
  Developed by GovTech, SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs 
  identifying details of individuals (identification card and mobile numbers) 
  visiting public venues such as malls and workplaces, as well as communal activity areas. 
  SafeEntry helps support and quicken efforts by providing authorities with a record of 
  individuals who enter and exit these places.
</p>
<p>
  These records will reduce the time needed to identify potential close contacts of 
  COVID-19 patients and clusters. We encourage everyone to use SafeEntry to check-in 
  and check-out when going about your daily activities.
</p>

<h3>How does SafeEntry work?</h3>
<p>
  To ensure that checking in and out is quick, convenient and accessible for all, 
  there are several check-in methods available for use, such as: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry QR</b> - Using the iPhone default camera app (for Apple users) or 
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trendmicro.qrscan&hl=en_SG">Trend Micro QR Scanner</a> 
    (for Android users), users can easily scan the QR code at locations that 
    require SafeEntry check-ins. From there, they will be redirected to a 
    browser page to key in their personal particulars and complete their check-in.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry with SingPass Mobile (SPM)</b> - SafeEntry has also been 
    integrated into the widely-used SPM app as a means to streamline the check-in process. 
    When authenticating through SingPass, users need not enter their details manually. 
    Users have the option of scanning the QR code via the 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAgug6uVKIc&feature=youtu.be">in-app scanner</a>
    or 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hp--r7ipUI&feature=youtu.be">
      selecting from a list of nearby locations
    </a> to complete the check-in process.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry NRIC</b> - As an alternative to these digital check-in processes, 
    users can opt to have their identification cards scanned at the entrances of locations. 
    A personalised barcode is also available on both the SingPass Mobile and 
    TraceTogether apps for scanning.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>SafeEntry with TraceTogether app</b> - SafeEntry has also integrated with the 
    TraceTogether app. Users can scan the SafeEntry QR code and check-in without entering 
    their details manually.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How is my data protected?</h3>
<p>
  The data collected via SafeEntry is encrypted and stored in the Government server, 
  which will only be accessed by the authorities for the purpose of contact tracing. 
  The Government is the custodian of the data submitted by individuals, and there are 
  stringent measures in place to safeguard personal data. Only authorised public officers 
  will have access to the data.
</p>
<p>The personal data will be purged when it is no longer needed for such purposes. </p>

<h3>Are location permissions mandatory?</h3>
<p>
  When using SingPass Mobile to check-in to a location, the app requires location permissions 
  to detect nearby locations for users to select. However, this data is strictly used for 
  SafeEntry purposes and users who do not wish to enable these permissions can opt to use 
  the QR scanning function or have their identification cards scanned instead.
