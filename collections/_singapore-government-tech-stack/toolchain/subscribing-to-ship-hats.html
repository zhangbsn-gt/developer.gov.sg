  Want to get started on SHIP-HATS? Check out the subscription launched on 1
  October 2020.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Subscription is on a monthly basis and available only to agencies as account
  holders. Agencies can extend subscriptions to non-agency users (e.g. Vendors).
  Each subscription is based on a tier plus any number of optional add-ons.
  Tiers include <strong>Starter, Squad, Team,</strong> and
  <strong>Tribe</strong>. The table below summarises resources and services
  allotted in each tier.

<h3>Services</h3>
<p>
  Services that SHIP-HATS brings to you, adhering to security and compliance
  requirements:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket</strong>
    <p>
      Used to track work, document, and manage code versioning respectively.
      Users listed in the table above refer to named users: discrete accounts
      whose activities will be audited and should not be shared. Content (eg.
      Confluence) configured for anonymous access do not need a named user to
      view.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bamboo</strong>
    <p>
      Continuous Integration (CI) orchestrator. CI agents (aka pipeline agents)
      come in 2 configurations: Elastic and Dedicated. Pipelines configured for
      elastic agents access them from a large common pool shared with other
      pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      In specific situations where agent availability needs to be more
      predictable, or configuration needs to be nuanced to the environment,
      dedicated agents can be subscribed to. As the name implies, these agents
      are available only to the subscriber.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Nexus Repo/Nexus IQ</strong>
    <p>
      Artifact repository/artifact vulnerability scanner respectively.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automated test farm (pCloudy)</strong>
    <p>
      Executes automated tests on browsers (desktop, mobile) and mobile apps.
      Mobile devices are physical equipment, managed via a desktop web browser.
      Automation is triggered from Bamboo using Robot Framework. Subscribers
      subscribe to dedicated mobile device add-on to restrict device
      availability to themselves. Physical device procurement is included in
      subscription.
