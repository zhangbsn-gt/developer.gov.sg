### Overview

Toolchain is a suite of services in SGTS with security and governance guardrails developers use to plan, build, test and deploy code to production.

### What is SHIP-HATS? 

**SHIP (Secure Hybrid Integration Pipeline)-HATS (Hive Agile Testing Solutions)** is the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD){:target="_blank"} component within SG Tech Stack (SGTS) with security and governance guardrails that enables developers to plan, build, test and deploy code to production.  

This is a multi-tenanted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hosted on Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) for all applications that is classified as restricted and below.

### Benefits of SHIP-HATS 

1. **Policy Compliance:** Standardised development tools and environment that is set up in compliance with **Application Infrastructure Architecture Standard (AIAS)** and **Instruction Manual 8 on Information Technology (IM8)** policies.
2. **Better Quality:** Automated security testing detects vulnerabilities early in the development cycle helping to deliver high quality applications.
3. **Visibility & Transparency:** Agencies will always have access to source code and hence a better understanding of how the project is progressing.
4. **Reduce Procurement:** Access to a whole suite of tools instead of sourcing individually.
5. **GovTech Managed:** The CI/CD tools are set-up, hosted, maintained and supported by GovTech letting you focus on your core application.
