## Cloud File Transfer

### Defining Cloud File Transfer

Cloud File Transfer (CFT) is a lightweight, fully managed, API-driven service that allows agencies or businesses to **transfer files easily, securely and efficiently at scale**, whether you are transferring files across internet and intranet zones or within the same internet or intranet zones. This product is currently in private beta version.

### A Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) Product

CFT is one of the **Communications** components within the Base Layer of the SGTS.

### APEX vs CFT

Today, the [IM8](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8) policy requires applications to be separated into internet and intranet zones. Transferring information across zones requires a bridging system. [API Exchange (APEX)](/technologies/data-and-apis/apex) was built to allow information sharing across zones. However, APEX is typically used for API requests - to share small payloads, usually as text.

To transfer large files such as PDFs, images or textual files, an agency would need to set up additional servers to act as file repositories in addition to the cross zones bridging capability. Implementing and maintaining such an infrastructure and constantly ensuring its compliance with IM8 policies/audits requires the agency to fork out additional time, money and manpower.

### CFT Transfer options

With CFT, agencies and businesses can easily and securely transfer files.
