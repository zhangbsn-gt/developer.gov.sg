Secure Data Migration is an essential step in cloud adoption, which involves **transferring data from an on-premise environment to a cloud environment**. This migration can be broadly classified into two categories:

### USING THE APPROPRIATE MIGRATION APPROACH

The table below highlights several considerations for project teams when deciding which migration approach to use.

### MANAGING SECURITY RISKS OF MIGRATING DATA TO THE CLOUD

Before migration, a risk assessment for the chosen approach should be completed with mitigation in place. This is to reduce undesirable impacts such as loss of data confidentiality and/or integrity. The table below describes key security risk areas associated with data migration and the recommended mitigation measures.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR PROJECT TEAMS

- Always identify the security risks first when planning for data migration to cloud environments.

- Be mindful of the security objectives, and adopt measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data throughout the entire migration process.
