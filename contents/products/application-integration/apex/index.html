        <p>Central Service Platform: With the current Government Web Services Exchange (GWS-X) end-of-life planned in Sep 2018, APEX is the alternative central platform for the whole-of-government to migrate their existing web services and create new APIs to share data.</p>
        <p>Robust Governance and Monitoring: APEX is a centralized point to manage, monitor and secure your APIs. The platform also provides real-time API monitoring and logging for auditing purposes.</p>
        <p>Easy and Sustainable Data Sharing: The automated workflow reduces the efforts required for both the Provider and the Consumer, thus encouraging the creation of innovative digital services that will be published through an API catalogue.</p>
        <p>Security: APEX supports APP ID and Secret, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Signing and OAuth for API security. The platform is also designed to be compliant with government’s security policies.</p>
        <p>Oversight and Control: APEX is a self-service portal. The APIs are governed and maintained by the API Provider agencies.</p>
        <p>Faster Delivery of Service: With the API catalogue, agencies can discover and reuse existing APIs to integrate with their existing technology stack. This reduces an agency’s development, integration and troubleshooting time, thereby speeding up service delivery.</p>
        <p>Cost Saving: Having a centralized and shared platform enables new projects to leverage on the infrastructure and operation cost.</p>
