            <p>A static information website is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It requires no server-side processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In simpler terms, it requires no use of the back-end.</p>
            <p>A static website is delivered to a user exactly the way it's stored. That means that nothing on the page will change by the user or even the site administrator, unless there's a redesign of the site or the site administrator goes directly into the code to change it.</p>
            <p>Nothing is stored but the actual pages of the site. There are no users, no comments, no blog posts or any interactivity. No programming languages are required to make a static site.</p>
            <p>All public facing digital services of the Government must meet the Digital Service Standards (DSS).</p>
            <p>The Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS, to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and businesses.</p>
            <p>GovTech provides Isomer to support government agencies in building static information websites while complying to DSS easily.</p>

            <p>A dynamic information website allow users to interact with it, such as commenting on a post, creating a user profile or scheduling an appointment. Examples of dynamic websites are blogs, calendar or any website that needs to be updated often.</p>
            <p>Dynamic websites use languages like PHP to interact with information stored in databases. You will need web hosting and databases or servers. Most dynamic websites utilise a Content Management System to manage their content.</p>
            <p>With these requirements, dynamic websites are usually more expensive to create and maintain.</p>

            <p>A transactional website has the ability to process financial transactions. Typical transactions include online banking, financial account management, bill payment, employee payroll and application processing.</p>
            <p>Government agencies set up transactional websites to allow citizens to pay taxes and fees conveniently online. In addition, government sites post tax, business and other types of forms designed to report income and other financial details.</p>
            <p>Transactional websites require adherence to strict security measures in order to ensure the safety of private financial information.</p>
            <p>All public facing digital services of the Government must meet the Digital Service Standards (DSS).</p>
            <p>The Government conducts mystery-shopping checks based on the DSS, to ensure that our digital services are implemented consistently that are easy, seamless and relevant for our citizens and businesses.</p>
            <p>Government agencies can work directly with their preferred vendor in developing the transactional websites.<p>
