## Development

### Requirements

-   Node.js v10 / npm v6
-   rbenv\* with Ruby 2.5

\*npm commands detailed below assume the usage of [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage your Ruby environment. See `package.json`.

### Local development

#### Setup

```sh
# Jekyll only
gem install jekyll bundler

bundler install

# For ruby 3.0 and above, as webrick is no longer a bundled gem in Ruby3.0
bundle add webrick

# Serve the files with jekyll
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Webpack/static files
npm install
```

#### Run locally - frontend only

Recommended: run webpack and jekyll in separate terminal sessions, the access the site through localhost:4000. This is to allow for easy termination of both processes.

```sh
npm run dev:concurrent
```
