<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>

All developers are able to access and tap on the wide range of open-source technologies by Government agencies. This includes a variety of products from a plethora of areas like digital identity, design and User Identity (UI), and infrastructure-as-code.  

You can also look at the open-source technologies that Singapore has used in its fight against COVID-19 such as [TraceTogether](/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/tracetogether/){:target="_blank"} and [VigilantGantry](/technologies/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/vigilantgantry/){:target="_blank"}.

</p>
<p>
  We have also open-sourced some of the digital tools that we are using in our
  fight against COVID-19.

        <h4>Form</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.form.gov.sg/">Form</a>
          builder and manager used by the Singapore government and public
          healthcare institutions to securely collect data from residents and
          businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Form has been used for various data collection especially during
          COVID-19 to minimise human contact and possible transmissions. Some of
          them include:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collecting travel and health declarations by visitors to the country.
          </li>
            <li>
              Swab tests applications.
            </li>
              <li>
                COVID-19 financial assistance applications and distributions.
              </li>
                <li>
                 Daily temperature declarations by citizens.
               </li>
                 <li>
                  Mandatory primary school registration for seven year olds nationwide.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Using Form grants legitimacy to government agencies collecting
          sensitive data, making it difficult for malicious actors to steal
          citizens' data. It also provides rich features that especially support
          public sector needs - such as table-input fields, one time password (OTP) verification,
          contact details, email domain restrictions, logic to disable
          submissions and date validations.
        </p>

        <h4>Go</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/">Go</a>
          is a Government link shortener granting legitimacy to content shared
          by public officers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/">Go.gov.sg</a>
          has been used for shortening links to various platforms.

          <li>
            <p>

                ><u>go.gov.sg/whatsapp</u></a
              >
              is an application form of the official WhatsApp broadcast of the
              Singapore government.
            </p>
          </li>

                ><u>go.gov.sg/passport</u></a
              >
              is an application of passport for Singaporean citizens.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Besides that, Go is also used in training materials for COVID-19
              healthcare volunteers, press releases about COVID-19, articles and
              documents.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It saves government agencies time when it comes to shortening a domain name. It  also lets citizens know that they
          are accessing information from a legitimate government source by ensuring consistency in domain names generated.

          Infrastructure-as-code technologies allow development teams to define
          their application infrastructure through declarative configuration
          files. This allows teams to deploy their infrastructure more quickly
          and consistently.
